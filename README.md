# Social-Network
A socket-programming Java & C++ system simulates a social network, using thread-per-client server (Java) and clients protocols (C++). 
The system was build in pursuance of an assignment at "System Programming" course at school.

The project is composed of two main sections:
1. Server side - The implementation of the TPC server including encoder-decoder and BGS-social-network protocol implementation. 
2. Client side - The implementation of CLient-Client and Client-Server communication protocol.
